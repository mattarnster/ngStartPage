# ngStartPage
An alternative New-Tab page written using Angular JS and Materialize CSS.

You can find a fully working version at [ngStartPage.uk](https://ngstartpage.uk) - it's running off of the `ngstartpage.uk` branch in git. Please feel free to use it. As always, your bookmarks are saved in local storage and never touch the server.

## Installation

Clone the repository, and then run `bower install`.

## Customisation

You can use the 'Settings' button (top-left) to add new websites to the bookmarks listing.

## Privacy

Your bookmarks are stored within the browser's HTML5 Local Storage. They are never sent anywhere else.

In the event that your browser does not offer the HTML5 Local Storage API, the bookmarks are stored in cookies - this is the failover which angular-local-storage provides.
